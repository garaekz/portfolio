# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/), [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It is fully TypeScript and ESLint configured, and uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing (not yet tested).

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

It shows some of my knowledge and experience with the technologies used, and it is also a way to show my work and projects to the world. You can contact me through the contact form, and also see my social media and GitHub.

## Project Setup

pnpm install

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production
