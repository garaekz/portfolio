      I'm a Software Engineer. Born and raise in Tijuana, MÃ©xico. I've started my career as a web developer in 2016 although I've been coding since 2006, at the age of 15. I've been working professionally with Laravel for over 8 years now. My first approach to Laravel was early on version 5 release, and I've been working with it since then. When Vue.js started to gain popularity it was quickly embraced by the Laravel community, and I was no exception. I've been working with Vue.js for over 7 years now, and I just love how it integrates with Laravel. At the time TailwindCSS was a thing, I was already using it, I quicly dropped Bootstrap and never looked back. I've been working with TailwindCSS for over 3 years now, and I just love how it helps me to build beautiful and responsive UIs with ease.

      Although I Love my main stack it's not secret I started my learning path with Python 2.7, leaning, grasping and understanding the basics of programming. Although I've never worked professionally with Python, it's always been my go-to language for quick scripts to run on my terminal. I tried a bunch of stacks and languages like Ruby on Rails, Node.js with frameworks like Nest.js and Express.js, and even tried some frontend frameworks like React and Svelte.

      By the year 2019 I started a new adventure in a company that main backend language was Go, I've never heard of this strange language before, but I was quickly embraced by it. I've been working with Go for over 2 years now, and I just love how it helps me to build fast and reliable services with ease. I'm also a big fan of the Go ecosystem, I love how it integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, and how it helps me to build scalable and reliable services. I'm trying to expand my knowledge on Go building small services and learning about the best practices and design patterns.
